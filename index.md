## A little bit about me...

I'm a Software / DevOps Engineer based in Sydney, Australia. A father of two and a passionate blue belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. I'm currently working for a company to which we are strong advocates of Agile methodology. My development background has always been Java, but not limited to the following skill sets:
- Git
- Python
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Gradle & Maven
- CI / CD
- AWS
- Spring

Majority of my posts will be based on my personal opinion as well as tutorials which I hope to share based on what I have learned. I don't normally blog, but this is one of the many ways that motivates me in learning. That being said, feedback is always welcome, and I hope you will enjoy my posts as much as I enjoy preparing it!
